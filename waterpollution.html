<h1> Water Pollution </h1>

<h2> Definition </h2>

<p> Water pollution is the contamination of water bodies. Water bodies include for example lakes, rivers, oceans, aquifers and groundwater.
Water pollution results when contaminants are introduced into the natural environment. For example, releasing inadequately treated wastewater into natural water bodies can lead to deteriation of ecosystems in bodies of water.
In turn, this can lead to public health problems for people living downstream. They may use the same polluted river water for drinking or bathing or irrigation. Water pollution is the leading worldwide cause of death and disease, for example, due to water-borne diseases.
</p>

<p> Water pollution can be classified as surface water or groundwater pollution. Marine pollution and nutrient pollution are subsets of water pollution.
Sources of water pollution are either point sources or non-point sources. Point sources have one identifiable cause of the pollution, such as a storm drain or a wastewater treatment plant.
Non-point sources are more diffuse, such as agricultural runoff. Pollution is the result of the cumulative effect over time. All plants and organisms living in or being exposed to polluted water bodies can be impacted.
The effects can damage individual species and impact the natural biological communities they are part of.
</p>

<p> The causes of water pollution include a wide range of chemicals and pathogens as well as physical parameters. Contaminants may include organic and inorganic substances.
Elevated temperatures can also lead to polluted water. A common cause of thermal pollution is the use of water as a coolant by power plants and industrial manufacturers.
Elevated water temperatures decrease oxygen levels, which can kill fish and alter food chain composition, reduce species biodiversity, and foster invasion by new thermophilic species (a type of bacteria, which survives in heat).
</p>

<p> Water pollution is measured by analysing water samples. Physical, chemical and biological tests can be conducted. Control of water pollution requires appropriate infrastructure and management plans.
The infrastructure may include wastewater treatment plants. Sewage treatment plants and industrial wastewater treatment plants are usually required to protect water bodies from untreated wastewater.
Agricultural wastewater treatment for farms, and erosion control at construction sites can also help prevent water pollution. Nature-based solutions are another approach to prevent water pollution.
Effective control of urban runoff includes reducing speed and quantity of flow. In the United States, best management practices for water pollution include approaches to reduce the quantity of water and improve water quality.
</p>

<h2> Causes </h2>

<h3> 1. Industrial Waste </h3>

<p> Industries produce a tremendous amount of waste, which contains toxic chemicals and pollutants, causing air pollution and damage to our environment and us. They contain harmful chemicals, including lead, mercury, sulfur, nitrates, asbestos, and many others. </p>

<p> Many industries, not having a proper waste management system, drain the waste in the freshwater, which goes into canals, rivers, and later into the sea. </p>

<p> The toxic chemicals may change the color of water, increase the number of minerals, called eutrophication, change the temperature of the water, and pose a severe hazard to water organisms. </p>

<h3> 2. Sewage and Wastewater </h3>

<p> The sewage and wastewater that is produced in each household are treated chemically and released into the sea along with fresh water. The sewage water carries pathogens, a typical water pollutant, other harmful bacterias, and chemicals that can cause serious health problems and thereby diseases. </p>

<p> Microorganisms in water are known to cause some of the very deadly diseases and become the breeding grounds for creatures that act as carriers. These carriers inflict these diseases onto an individual via various forms of contact. A typical example would be Malaria. </p>

<h3> 3. Mining Activities </h3>

<p> Mining is the process of crushing the rock and extracting coal and other minerals from the underground. These elements, when extracted in the raw form, contain harmful chemicals and can increase the number of toxic elements when mixed up with water, which may result in health problems. Mining activities emit a large amount of metal waste and sulfides from the rocks, which is harmful to the water. </p>

<h3> 4. Marine Dumping </h3>

<p> The garbage produced by households in the form of paper, plastic, food, aluminum, rubber, glass, is collected and dumped into the sea in some countries. These items take 2 weeks to 200 years to decompose. </p>

<p> When such things enter the sea, they not only cause water pollution but also harm animals in the sea. </p>

<h3> 5. Accidental Oil Leakage </h3>

<p> Oil spill poses a huge threat to marine life when a large amount of oil spills into the sea and does not dissolve in water. It causes problems for local marine wildlife, including fish, birds, and sea otters. </p>

<p> A ship carrying a large quantity of oil may spill oil if met with an accident. Such an oil spill can cause varying damage to species in the ocean, depending on the amount of oil spill, the toxicity of pollutants, and the size of the ocean.</p>

<h3> 6. The Burning of Fossil Fuels </h3>

<p> Fossil fuels like coal and oil, when burnt, produce a substantial amount of ash in the atmosphere. The particles which contain toxic chemicals when mixed with water vapor result in acid rain. Also, carbon dioxide is released from the burning of fossil fuels, which results in global warming. </p>

<h3> 7. Chemical fertilizers and pesticides </h3>

<p> Chemical fertilizers and pesticides are used by farmers to protect crops from insects and bacterias. They are useful for the plant’s growth. However, when these chemicals are mixed up with water, they produce harmful pollutants for plants and animals. </p>

<p> Also, when it rains, the chemicals mix up with rainwater and flow down into rivers and canals, which pose serious damages for aquatic animals. </p>

<h3> 8. Leakage From Sewer Lines </h3>

<p> A small leakage from the sewer lines can contaminate the underground water and make it unfit for the people to drink. Also, when not repaired on time, the leaking water can come on to the surface and become a breeding ground for insects and mosquitoes. </p>

<h3> 9. Global Warming </h3>

<p> An increase in the earth’s temperature results in global warming due to the greenhouse effect. It increases the water temperature and results in the death of aquatic animals and marine species, which later results in water pollution. </p>

<h3> 10. Radioactive Waste </h3>

<p> Nuclear energy is produced using nuclear fission or fusion. The element that is used in the production of nuclear energy is Uranium, which is a highly toxic chemical. </p>

<p> The nuclear waste that is produced by radioactive material needs to be disposed of to prevent any nuclear accident. Nuclear waste can have serious environmental hazards if not disposed of properly. Few major accidents have already taken place in Russia and Japan. </p>

<h3> 11. Urban Development </h3>

<p> As the population has grown exponentially, so has the demand for housing, food, and cloth. As more cities and towns are developed, they have resulted in increasing use of fertilizers to produce more food, soil erosion due to deforestation, rise in construction activities, inadequate sewer collection and treatment, landfills as more garbage is produced, increase in chemicals from industries to produce more materials. </p>

<h3> 12. Leakage From the Landfills </h3>

<p> Landfills are nothing but a massive pile of garbage that produces the awful smell and can be seen across the city. When it rains, the landfills may leak, and the leaking landfills can pollute the underground water with a large variety of contaminants. </p>

<h3> 13. Animal Waste </h3>

<p> The waste produced by animals washed away into the rivers when it rains. It then gets mixed up with other harmful chemicals and causes various water-borne diseases like cholera, diarrhea, dysentery, jaundice, and typhoid. </p>

<h3> 14. Underground Storage Leakage </h3>

<p> Transportation of coal and other petroleum products through underground pipes is well known. Accidental leakage may happen anytime and may cause damage to the environment and result in soil erosion. </p>

<h3> 15. Eutrophication </h3>

<p> The increased level of nutrients in water bodies is known as Eutrophication. It results in the bloom of algae in the water. It also depletes the amount of oxygen in the water that negatively affects fish and other aquatic animal populations. </p>

<h3> 16. Acid Rain </h3>

<p> Acid rain is essentially water pollution caused by air pollution. When the acidic particles released in the atmosphere by air pollution mix with water vapor, it results in acid rain. </p>

<h2> Effects </h2>

<h3> Death of Aquatic animals </h3>

<p> The main problem caused by water pollution is that it kills organisms that depend on these water bodies. Dead fish, crabs, birds and seagulls, dolphins, and many other animals often wind up on beaches, killed by pollutants in their habitat. </p>

<h3> Disruption of Food Chains </h3>

<p> Pollution disrupts the natural food chain as well. Pollutants such as lead and cadmium are eaten by tiny animals. Later, these animals are consumed by fish and shellfish, and the food chain continues to be disrupted at all higher levels. </p>

<h3> Diseases </h3>

<p> Eventually, humans are affected by this process too. People can get diseases such as hepatitis by eating seafood that has been contaminated. In many poor regions, there is frequently an outbreak of cholera and diseases as a result of poor drinking water treatment from contaminated waters. </p>

<h3> Destruction of Ecosystems </h3>

<p> Ecosystems can be severely changed or destroyed by water pollution. Many areas are now being affected by careless human pollution, and this pollution is coming back to hurt humans in many ways. </p>

<h2> Solutions </h2>

<h3> 1. Practice responsible use of fertilizer, herbicides, and pesticides. </h3>

<p> Read and explicitly follow the directions for mixing and use.
Use organic options whenever possible. Check your local stormwater division for suggestions.
Prevent spills. As spills are generally accidental, prepare in advance to contain and absorb the solution if there is a spill.
Don’t leave the unused chemicals exposed to weather. Dispose of the leftover chemicals and container properly per the product instructions, or check with your local municipality.
Do not apply near water systems such as wells, streams, lakes, or curb inlets/drains.
</p>

<h3> 2. Never dispose cooking fats and oils by pouring them down the sink. </h3>

<p> This is a big problem with groundwater contamination in yards, so if you have a well you should be doubly concerned with properly disposing of fat, grease, and oil.
</p>

<h3> 3. Plant trees or any plants near bodies of water. </h3>

<p> So that when it rains, the topsoil with personal chemicals will not get washed away. Big trees will help prevent soil erosion. When the soil is eroded, the pesticides and chemicals on the land will be washed away and carried on the sea.
But if there are big trees to stop the eroding of the soil, the Oceans will be protected!
</p>

<h3> 4. Do not make your toilet as your wastebasket. </h3>

<p> Do not flush unnecessary things in the toilet because this will only clog up your drains. Most tissues, wrappers, dust cloths, and other paper goods should be properly discarded in a wastebasket.
Throwing them in your toilet is unsustainable, and it will only lead to massive pollution in the end.
</p>

<h3> 5. Avoid using plastics if possible especially when dining. </h3>

<p> Say no to straws, plastic cups, and plastic utensils when you dine and get out in the beach. Around the world, one million plastic drinking bottles are purchased every minute, while up to 5 trillion single-use plastic bags are used worldwide every year.
In total, half of all plastic produced is designed to be used only once, and then thrown away! Here a 4 simple ways to reduce your plastic consumption :

REFUSE disposable plastic whenever and wherever possible. Choose items that are not packaged in plastic, and carry your own bags, containers and utensils. Say ‘no straw, please.’

REDUCE your plastic footprint. Cut down on your consumption of goods that contain excessive plastic packaging and parts. If it will leave behind plastic trash, don’t buy it.

REUSE durable, non-toxic straws, utensils, to-go containers, bottles, bags, and other everyday items. Choose glass, paper, Stainless steel Straws, wood, ceramic and bamboo over plastic.

RECYCLE what you can’t refuse, reduce or reuse. Pay attention to the entire life cycle of items you bring into your life, from source to manufacturing to distribution to disposal.

</p>

<h3> 6. Do your part by picking up some litter that you see in the environment. </h3>

<p> Especially near rivers, rivers carry plastic waste from deep inland to the sea, making them major contributors to Ocean pollution. A staggering 8 million tonnes of plastic end up in the world’s oceans every year. </p>

<h3> 7. Ensure minimal use of bleach or detergents. </h3>

<p> Water pollution by chemicals (such as detergents) is a big concern in the global context. Many laundry detergents contain approximately 35 percent to 75 percent phosphate salts. Phosphates can cause a variety of water pollution problems.
For example, phosphate tends to inhibit the biodegradation of organic substances. </p>

<p> During cleaning of laundry or cutleries, it is vital to minimize the use of bleach and detergents.
Instead, you can persist on only using phosphate-free detergents and soaps. </p>

<h3> 8. Practice tree planting. </h3>

<p> Trees are the unsung heroes of urban life. It’s hard to overstate their benefits: They filter pollution out of the air, lower our energy bills, undercut the misery of summer heat, raise property values, etc. </p>

<p> Planting trees reduce the speed of surface water runoff and as such, lessens erosion and prevents toxic substances and chemicals from washing into water systems.
Trees are excellent at managing storm water. In essence, they act like mini-reservoirs, capturing and storing rainfall and melting snow. This helps reduce the volume of storm water runoff that enters our storm sewers. </p>

<p> So if you live next to a water body, please take this initiative today and plant trees and vegetation covers such as flowers, grass, and shrubs. </p>

<h3> 9. Watch how much water you use. </h3>

<p> You might be surprised to find out just how much water you use in a day and how much you can save on water and on your water bill. For example, when brushing your teeth, make sure to turn off the tap while you do so. </p>

<h3> 10. Eat More Organic Food. </h3>

<p> While chemicals can be used on organic foods, they tend to be produced with few synthetic chemicals. Eating organic reduces the amount of chemical pollution that ends up in the water. <p>

<p> The food we choose to eat has a huge impact on environmental quality, between the chemicals used to grow food, the fuel used to transport the crops, and the fuel used to power farm equipment on industrial farms. </p>

<h3> 11. Keep Your Vehicles from Leaking. </h3>

<p> Spilt oil can pollute streams, rivers and, if it soaks through the soil and rock, groundwater. Oil pollution can have a devastating effect on the water environment, it spreads over the surface in a thin layer that stops oxygen getting to the plants and animals that live in the water.
Just 1 liter of oil can contaminate 1 million liters of water. This runoff problem is easy to treat, just be rigourus about maintaining and repairing your vehicles. </p>

<h3> 12. Buy Sustainable Meats. </h3>

<p> While we all enjoy a hamburger from time to time, it is important to think about the impact of factory farms on our water supply. These farms produce huge amounts of waste, which ends up harming the nearby water supplies.
Whenever possible, buy sustainable meats instead of those produced at factory farms. </p>

<h3> 13. Support Environmental Charities. <h3>

<p> No matter where you live in the country, there are going to be charities working on watershed protection, water pollution cleanup, and similar causes. Find an organization that’s active in your area and make a donation every year.
Your support may even lead to expanded anti-pollution work. </p>

<h3> 14. Laws and Regulations </h3>

<p> Laws and regulations can also help to prevent and mitigate pollution, if they are effectively designed and enforced. Local, state and federal laws, as well as international efforts, set limits on pollution and create accountability for those who might otherwise dump contaminants. </p>

<p> For these regulations to work well, they should be based on science and designed in a way that prevents loopholes and makes them easy to understand. They also need to be enforced honestly without improper exceptions. </p>

<h3> 15. Shop with Water Pollution in Mind. </h3>

<p> You can avoid issues with household chemicals and pesticides by not buying products that contain permanent and dangerous chemicals in the first place. Many companies now sell non-toxic cleaners and biodegradable cleaners and pesticides. Spending a little extra money on those products automatically cuts down on water pollution. </p>
