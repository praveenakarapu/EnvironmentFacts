<h1> Car Pollution </h1>

<h3> Car pollution is a very harmful form of air pollution. </h3>

<h2> What is Car Pollution? </h2>

<p> While people feel that thy're lucky to have cars, they are responsible for car pollution, which is a type of air pollution. 
Car engines release poisonous gases such as carbon monoxide, an extremely dangerous greenhouse gas. Carbon monoxide can cause people to become really sick or even die.
80% of lung diseases are a result of car pollution. It's easy for children to get sick after breathing carbon monoxide, so make sure that you aren't in a place where you're breathing the gases from a car, such as the back of a car when the engine is on.
</p>

<h2> Effects on the Environment </h2>

<p> Car pollution causes rapid and lasting effects on the environment. One of the majoer effects on the environment is global warming.
Global warming is the increase of the Earth's temperature. If it isn't controlled, then plants, animals, and humans will die.
Did you ever sit too close to a fire and start to feel too hot? If you did, you'd probably move back from the fire.
If global warming gets out of control, it will be the same thing, except nobody will be able to move back from it. </p>

<p> Another effect that car pollution has is acid rain. Acid rain is a very dangerous form of rain that is formed when poisonous gases are blown into the sky, mixes with the clouds, and poisonous pain comes out.
Acid rain can kill plants, kill animals that live in lakes or rivers, and can contaminate our water. </p>
