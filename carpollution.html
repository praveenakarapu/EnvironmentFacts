<h1> Car Pollution </h1>

<h2> Definition </h2>

<p> While people feel that thy're lucky to have cars, they are responsible for car pollution, which is a type of air pollution. 
Car engines release poisonous gases such as carbon monoxide, an extremely dangerous greenhouse gas. Carbon monoxide can cause people to become really sick or even die.
80% of lung diseases are a result of car pollution. It's easy for children to get sick after breathing carbon monoxide, so make sure that you aren't in a place where you're breathing the gases from a car, such as the back of a car when the engine is on.
</p>

<h2> Causes </h2>

<p> Power plants and motor vehicles create this pollutant by burning sulfur-containing fuels, especially diesel and coal. </p>

<h2> Effects </h2>

<p> Car pollution causes rapid and lasting effects on the environment. One of the majoer effects on the environment is global warming.
Global warming is the increase of the Earth's temperature. If it isn't controlled, then plants, animals, and humans will die.
Did you ever sit too close to a fire and start to feel too hot? If you did, you'd probably move back from the fire.
If global warming gets out of control, it will be the same thing, except nobody will be able to move back from it. </p>

<p> Another effect that car pollution has is acid rain. Acid rain is a very dangerous form of rain that is formed when poisonous gases are blown into the sky, mixes with the clouds, and poisonous pain comes out.
Acid rain can kill plants, kill animals that live in lakes or rivers, and can contaminate our water. </p>

<h2> Solutions </h2>

<h3> 1. Ride a Bike or Walk </h3>

<p> If you're only going a short distance, ride a bike or walk instead of driving. You can get exercise and enjoy the fresh air. </p>

<h3> 2. Take Public Transit </h3>

<p> If you need to go somewhere that is along a bus or light rail line, consider taking public transit instead of going in a car. </p>

<h3> 3. Carpool </h3>

<p> When going to school or work, go with other people who are going to the same place. You can save money and reduce the amount of fuel used at the same time. </p>

<h3> 4. Avoid Idling </h3>

<p> When idling, you waste fuel when you don't move. If you'll be in the same spot for a while, turn off your veichle's engine (as long as it is safe to do so). </p>

<h3> 5. Use Alternative Fuels </h3>

<p> Alter native fuels are cleaner than regular gasoline or diesel. Alternative fuel vehicles include electric vehicles and flex-fuel vehicles that can use ethanol blends.
Most new electric vehicles now have a range of over 100 miles, which meets most peopleâ€™s daily commuting needs.
Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and extended range electric vehicles use gasoline as well and therefore do not have a range limit.
Flex-fuel vehicles can use ethanol blends that are up to 85% ethanol and regular cars that are newer than 2001 can use ethanol blends that have up to 15% ethanol.
Ethanol is made from crops such as corn and helps support American farmers. </p>
