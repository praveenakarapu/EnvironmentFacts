<h1> Radioactive Pollution </h1>

<h2> Definition </h2>

<p> Radioactive contamination, also called radiological contamination and radioactive, is the deposition of, or presence of radioactive substances on surfaces or within solids, liquids or gases (including the human body), where their presence is unintended or undesirable (from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) definition). </p>

<p> Such contamination presents a hazard because of the radioactive decay of the contaminants, which produces such harmful effects as ionizing radiation (namely α, β, and γ rays) and free neutrons. The degree of hazard is determined by the concentration of the contaminants, the energy of the radiation being emitted, the type of radiation, and the proximity of the contamination to organs of the body. It is important to be clear that the contamination gives rise to the radiation hazard, and the terms "radiation" and "contamination" are not interchangeable. </p>

<p> The sources of radioactive pollution can be classified into two groups: natural and man made. Following an atmospheric nuclear weapon discharge or a nuclear reactor containment breach, the air, soil, people, plants, and animals in the vicinity will become contaminated by nuclear fuel and fission products. A spilled vial of radioactive material like uranyl nitrate may contaminate the floor and any rags used to wipe up the spill. Cases of widespread radioactive contamination include the Bikini Atoll, the Rocky Flats Plant in Colorado, the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, the Chernobyl disaster, and the area around the Mayak facility in Russia. </p>

<h2> Causes </h2>

<h3> 1. Nuclear Accidents From Nuclear Energy Generation Plants </h3>

<p> In the postmodern world, various forms of energy are being discovered. Among them is nuclear energy, which is touted to be the most potent source of energy due to its high latent power. Reports indicate that the high latent power is due to its high level of radiation. </p>

<p> Its use is, therefore, prohibited, but research is underway to determine its environmental safety and to put in place the most appropriate precautionary measures for its use. In some cases and countries, however, nuclear power plant accidents like the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster (2011), Chernobyl disaster (1986), and Three Mile Island accident (1979) left many dead and even many more affected by the radiation released. </p>

<h3> 2. The Use of Nuclear Weapons as Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) </h3>

<p> The use of nuclear missiles and atomic bombs, a form of nuclear energy, in the Second World War explains not only the cause but also the damaging nature of radioactive pollution or contamination. </p>

<p> The effects of those two strikes in Hiroshima and Nagasaki that prompted the end of the war in 1945 have been seen to date with children born with complications such as mental retardation as well as conditions like autism and other disorders. The number of cancer cases present in the two towns is more than those of the rest of Japan. </p>

<h3> 3. Use of Radioisotopes </h3>

<p> Radioisotopes are used to make detectors and in other industrial activities. Isotopes such as uranium have high concentrations of radiation in them. On the other hand, common Isotopes such as carbon-containing radioactive material are easily found in waterways through sewage lines. </p>

<p> Since most of the raw sewage is untreated before release, once released, the isotope combines with other compounds and elements present in water. This is the same water that people fetch for domestic use. Moreover, fishes use the same water to survive. Consumption of these fishes and from contaminated water sources means the potential intake of radiation. </p>

<h3> 4. Mining </h3>

<p> Mining mostly involves the excavation of the mineral ores, which are then broken into smaller, manageable pieces. Radium and Uranium, for instance, are naturally occurring in the environment and are equally radioactive. </p>

<p> Hence, mining increases the natural geological processes by moving these materials from underneath the earth to the surface. Other minerals with a hint of radiation are thorium, plutonium, radon, potassium, carbon and phosphorus. </p>

<h3> 5. Spillage of Radioactive Chemicals </h3>

<p> There have been instances of spillages over oceans when ships hit glaciers or coral reefs and end up releasing chemicals on waterways and in the atmosphere. The majority of these chemicals, including petroleum products, have a significant level of radiation, which can be detrimental to the environment. </p>

<h3> 6. Tests on Radiation </h3>

<p> Radiation has been seen to have a lot of interesting properties, which has promoted a lot of scientists to conduct tests to learn more about it. It is one of the key elements in the cure and treatment of cancer. </p>

<p> Chemotherapy, a cancer curative health initiative, uses radiation to prevent further growth of the cancer cells as well as keep the immune system strong. Despite this, scientists have been exposed to radiation leading to their deaths or other complications. </p>

<p> As per the report to the UN General Assembly in 2000, nuclear testing is the main reason for human exposure to radioactivity caused by man. </p>

<h3> 7. Cosmic Rays and Other Natural Sources </h3>

<p> These come from the outer space to our planet with intense radiation as their nature, therefore, causing radioactive pollution. Gamma rays, for example, are said to have the highest level of radiation and yet, depending on their intensity, some are not visible to the human eye. The quantity with which the rays hit the earth depends on the altitude of the earth and the geographical location. </p>

<p> There may be terrestrial radiations from radioactive elements present in the earth’s crust. These radioactive elements include potassium 40, radium 224, radon 222, thorium 232, uranium 235, uranium 238, and carbon 14 and occur in rocks, soil and water. </p>

<p> There can also be unstable radio-nuclides split into smaller parts emitting energetic radiation that can enter into the body of organisms through the air during respiration. </p>

<h3> 8. Nuclear Waste Handling and Disposal </h3>

<p> The radioactive wastes are of three categories- high level, low level and transuranic. They mainly comprise of the disposal from nuclear weapons, the cleaning materials from nuclear plants, military installations, emitted from plutonium processing and other radioisotopes from hospitals and laboratories. </p>

<p> The handling and disposal of nuclear waste may generate low to medium radiation over a long period of time. Their effects are not only hard to predict but may not be easily distinguishable as the radioactivity may contaminate and propagate through air, water, and soil as well. Moreover, identifying locations of some nuclear waste is not easy. </p>

<p> The main issue is that the radiation waste cannot be degraded or treated chemically or biologically. The only options are either to contain the waste storing in tightly closed containers shielded with radiation-protective materials (such as Pb) or dilute it. </p>

<p> It can also be contained by storage in remote areas with little or no life like remote caves or abandoned salt mines. However, natural or artificial whatever shields are used may get damaged over time. </p>

<p> Moreover, waste disposal practices in the past may not have used appropriate measures to isolate the radiation. Therefore, those areas need to be identified carefully, and restrictions promptly imposed. </p>

<h3> 9. Defensive Weapon Production </h3>

<p> The production of defensive weapons that may release radioactivity from the radioactive materials handled usually have high health risks. However, the current standards will not allow the release of any significant amount of radiation unless an accident occurs. </p>
