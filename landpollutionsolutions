<h1> Here are solutions to land polution. </h1>

<p>
1. Make people aware of the concept of Reduce, Recycle and Reuse.
2. Reusing materials help to reduce the requirement of harvesting resources. The products that cannot be reused can likely be recycled.
3. Reduce the use of pesticides and fertilizers in agricultural activities.
4. Reduce the use of non-biodegradable materials. By simply switching to a reusable cloth bag for groceries instead of plastic shopping bags will help cut down on the need for non-biodegradable materials.
5. Avoid buying packaged items as they will lead to creating garbage and end up in the landfill site.
6. Ensure that you do not litter on the ground and do proper disposal of garbage.
7. Buy biodegradable products.
8. Do organic gardening and eat organic food that will be grown without the use of pesticides or insecticide.
9. Create dumping ground away from residential areas.
10. Avoid littering and properly dispose of waste, which is an essential measure against land pollution both for households as well as for industries.
11. Education is the key to alleviate the land pollution problem. We have to show people the adverse effects of land pollution and the way to reduce it. Convincing others can motivate every one of us to make a significant contribution to save our environment.
