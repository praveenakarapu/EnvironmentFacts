<h1> This page will talk about 5 solutions to the problem car pollution. </h1>

<h3> The pollution from vehicles is a major cause of health problems such as asthma. Everyone benefits from clean air.
If you follow these actions, then the amount of car pollution will decrease. </h3>

<h2> 1. Ride a Bike or Walk </h2>

<p> If you're only going a short distance, ride a bike or walk instead of driving. You can get exercise and enjoy the fresh air. </p>

<h2> 2. Take Public Transit </h2>

<p> If you need to go somewhere that is along a bus or light rail line, consider taking public transit instead of going in a car. </p>

<h2> 3. Carpool </h2>

<p> When going to school or work, go with other people who are going to the same place. You can save money and reduce the amount of fuel used at the same time. </p>

<h2> 4. Avoid Idling </h2>

<p> When idling, you waste fuel when you don't move. If you'll be in the same spot for a while, turn off your veichle's engine (as long as it is safe to do so). </p>

<h2> 5. Use Alternative Fuels </h2>

<p> Alter native fuels are cleaner than regular gasoline or diesel. Alternative fuel vehicles include electric vehicles and flex-fuel vehicles that can use ethanol blends.
Most new electric vehicles now have a range of over 100 miles, which meets most peopleâ€™s daily commuting needs.
Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and extended range electric vehicles use gasoline as well and therefore do not have a range limit.
Flex-fuel vehicles can use ethanol blends that are up to 85% ethanol and regular cars that are newer than 2001 can use ethanol blends that have up to 15% ethanol.
Ethanol is made from crops such as corn and helps support American farmers. </p>
