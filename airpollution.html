<h1> Air Pollution </h1>

<h2> Definition </h2>

<p> Air pollution is the presence of substances in the atmosphere that are harmful to the health of humans and other living beings, or cause damage to the climate or to materials. There are different types of air pollutants, such as gases (such as ammonia, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxides, methane and chlorofluorocarbons), particulates (both organic and inorganic), and biological molecules. Air pollution may cause diseases, allergies and even death to humans; it may also cause harm to other living organisms such as animals and food crops, and may damage the natural or built environment. Both human activity and natural processes can generate air pollution. </p>

<p> Air pollution is a significant risk factor for a number of pollution-related diseases, including respiratory infections, heart disease, COPD, stroke and lung cancer. The human health effects of poor air quality are far reaching, but principally affect the body's respiratory system and the cardiovascular system. Individual reactions to air pollutants depend on the type of pollutant a person is exposed to, the degree of exposure, and the individual's health status and genetics. Indoor air pollution and poor urban air quality are listed as two of the world's worst toxic pollution problems in the 2008 Blacksmith Institute World's Worst Polluted Places report. Outdoor air pollution alone causes 2.1 to 4.21 million deaths annually. Overall, air pollution causes the deaths of around 7 million people worldwide each year, and is the world's largest single environmental health risk. </p>

<p> Productivity losses and degraded quality of life caused by air pollution are estimated to cost the world economy $5 trillion per year. Various pollution control technologies and strategies are available to reduce air pollution. </p>

<h2> Causes </h2>
  
<p> Air pollution is caused by solid and liquid particles and certain gases that are suspended in the air. These particles and gases can come from car and truck exhaust, factories, dust, pollen, mold spores, volcanoes and wildfires. The solid and liquid particles suspended in our air are called aerosols. </p>

<h2> Effects </h2>

<p> Around the world, nine out of 10 people breathe unhealthy air. </p>

<p> Air pollution is now the biggest environmental risk for early death, responsible for as many as 5 million premature deaths each year from heart attacks, strokes, diabetes and respiratory diseases. That’s more than the deaths from AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria combined. </p>

<p> Children, the elderly, people with existing diseases, and minority and low-income communities are particularly vulnerable to adverse health outcomes and economic impacts, such as missed work days, from exposure to air pollution. </p>

<p> Research suggests that long term exposure to some pollutants increases the risk of emphysema more than smoking a pack of cigarettes a day. And recent studies show air pollution can impact mental health, worker productivity and even stock market performance. </p>

<h2> Solutions </h2>

<h3> Actions You Can Take to Reduce Air Pollution </h3>

<p> 1. Conserve energy at home, at work, everywhere. </p>
<p> 2. Look for the ENERGY STAR label when buying home or office equipment. </p>
<p> 3. Use carpool, public transportation, bike, or walk whenever possible. </p>
<p> 4. Follow gasoline refueling instructions for efficient vapor recovery, being careful not to spill fuel and always tightening your gas cap securely. </p>
<p> 5. Consider purchasing portable gasoline containers labeled “spill-proof,” where available. </p>
<p> 6. Keep cars, boats, and other vehicles with engines properly tuned. </p>
<p> 7. Be sure your tires are properly inflated. </p>
<p> 8. Use environmentally safe paints and cleaning products whenever possible.
<p> 9. Mulch or compost leaves and yard waste.
<p> 10. Use gas logs instead of wood. </p>

<h3> On Days when High Ozone Levels are Expected, Take these Extra Steps to Reduce Pollution </h3>

<p> 1. Share a ride to work or use public transportation. </p>
<p> 2. Combine errands and reduce trips. Walk to errands when possible. </p>
<p> 3. Avoid excessive idling of your automobile. </p>
<p> 4. Refuel your car in the evening when its cooler. </p>
<p> 5. Conserve electricity and set air conditioners no lower than 78 degrees. </p>
<p> 6. Postpone lawn and gardening chores that use gasoline-powered equipment, or wait until evening. </p>

<h3> On Days when High Particle Levels are Expected, Take these Extra Steps to Reduce Pollution </h3>

<p> 1. Reduce the number of trips you take in your car. </p>
<p> 2. Reduce or eliminate fireplace and wood stove use. </p>
<p> 3. Avoid burning leaves, trash, and other materials. </p>
<p> 4. Avoid using gas-powered lawn and other garden equipment. </p>
