<h2> 10. Use of Modern Acoustic Wall Panels </h2>

<p> Not all wall panels incredibly serve well at reducing noise pollution. Because of technological advancements, there are modern designed acoustic wall panel options available in the market that can effectively reduce noise pollution. </p>

<h2> 11. Turn off Electronic Devices or Reduce the Volume </h2>

<p> Game systems, computers, Hi-fi systems, and televisions can contribute to noise pollution when on high volumes. The solution is to turn them off when not in use and also keep them on moderate volume to reduce noise pollution. </p>

<p> Besides, by turning them off, you’ll also be saving electricity costs. Place padding under noisy equipment to reduce noise, such as blenders. </p>

<h2> 12. Use Noise Absorbants in Noisy Mystery </h2>

<p> If some pieces of machinery are creating noise due to vibrations, you can check the noise by applying some noise absorbents to reduce noise. </p>

<h2> 13. Do Frequent Lubrication and Better Maintenance of Machinery </h2>

<p> Proper lubrication and better maintenance of machines are beneficial practices to reduce noise pollution and improve efficiency. As lubrication reduces friction between movable parts, it helps to reduce noise. </p>

<h2> 14. Plant Trees </h2>

<p> Trees have been established to be effective in reducing noise levels within urban settings, around major highways, and even at the places, we stay. </p>

<p> Therefore, numerous plants and trees in an area mean less noise pollution. In addition to that, trees have various aesthetic advantages and improve air quality. </p>

<h2> 15. Have a Dedicated Quiet Space </h2>

<p> Having a dedicated quiet space can pay off whenever we want to escape from noises that make us feel uneasy and affect the quality of our life. Quiet spaces can guarantee as much as 100% soundproof areas. </p>

<h2> 16. Install Cubicles and Wall Partitions <h2>

<p> Installation of wall partitions and cubicles in places such as offices with ample free space and big rooms at home reduces the overall indoor noise. Even with low-level installation, cubicles and wall partitions proved to be very useful noise absorbers. </p>

<h2> 17. Shut the Door </h2>

<p> Shutting the door keeps away unpleasant sounds, especially if you have noisy neighbors. If there are appliances that produce loud noise such as dishwashers, blenders, and washing machines, you can have them run in separate rooms and shut the door to seal off the noise. </p>

<h2> 18. Cancel or Mask the Noise </h2>

<p> Canceling or masking the noise is one of the most straightforward and practical techniques for reducing noise pollution. It is achieved through the creation of peaceful and soothing sounds to cancel the awful ones. </p>

<p> It can simply be done by turning on a fan or hanging wind chimes. For the majority of people, it may seem contradictory, but it is a proven effective method of masking or canceling the horrible and bothering sounds. </p>

<p> Furthermore, there are white noise machines that can make canceling or masking easier. </p>

<h2> 19. Move or Choose a Home in Noise-Free Areas </h2>

<p> Moving away from noisy areas can also qualify as a practical way of reducing noise pollution. It may sound exaggerated, but moving from areas such as airports, train stations, industrial districts, and major highways can reduce noise levels considerably. </p>

<h2> 20. Replace Old Automobiles with New Ones </h2>

<p> Old automobiles are a significant source of noise pollution. They create unappealing and sometimes deafening sounds. Their replacement with new ones not only reduces noise pollution but will also lower the emission of soot and other toxic substances into the atmosphere. </p>

<h2> 21. Create Awareness and Education on the Consequences of Noise Pollution </h2>

<p> Creating awareness of noise pollution and its effects on both humans and wildlife can generate positive outcomes in efforts to reduce noise pollution. </p>

<p> Perhaps if most people could be aware that noise pollution can lead to hearing loss and mental stress, then the majority will invest in ways to reduce noise pollution. </p>

<h2> 22. Declare a “No Horn Zone” in Hospital, School, and Residential Areas </h2>

<p> Horns from trucks, buses, and cars produce a considerable degree of noise pollution and as such, the introduction of no horn zone can help reduce noise pollution in hospitals, schools, and residential areas. </p>

<h2> 23. Let’s all be Good Neighbors </h2>
