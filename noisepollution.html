<h1> Noise Pollution </h1>

<h2> Definition </h2>

<p> Noise pollution, also known as environmental noise or sound pollution, is the propagation of noise with ranging impacts on the activity of human or animal life, most of them harmful to a degree. The source of outdoor noise worldwide is mainly caused by machines, transport, and propagation systems. Poor urban planning may give rise to noise disintegration or pollution, side-by-side industrial and residential buildings can result in noise pollution in the residential areas. Some of the main sources of noise in residential areas include loud music, transportation (traffic, rail, airplanes, etc.), lawn care maintenance, construction, electrical generators, explosions, and people. </p>

<p> Documented problems associated with noise in urban environments go back as far as ancient Rome. Today, the average noise level of 98 decibels (dB) exceeds the WHO value of 50 dB allowed for residential areas. Research suggests that noise pollution is the highest in low-income and racial minority neighborhoods, and noise pollution associated with household electricity generators is an emerging environmental degradation in many developing nations. </p>

<p> High noise levels can contribute to cardiovascular effects in humans and an increased incidence of coronary artery disease. In animals, noise can increase the risk of death by altering predator or prey detection and avoidance, interfere with reproduction and navigation, and contribute to permanent hearing loss. A substantial amount of the noise that humans produce occurs in the ocean. Up until recently, most research on noise impacts has been focused on marine mammals, and to a lesser degree, fish. In the past few years, scientists have shifted to conducting studies on invertebrates and their responses to anthropogenic sounds in the marine environment. This research is essential, especially considering that invertebrates make up 75% of marine species, and thus compose a large percentage of ocean food webs. Of the studies that have been conducted, a sizable variety in families of invertebrates have been represented in the research. A variation in the complexity of their sensory systems exists, which allows scientists to study a range of characteristics and develop a better understanding of anthropogenic noise impacts on living organisms. </p>

<h2> Causes </h2>

<h3> 1. Industrialization </h3>

<p> Most of the industries use big machines which are capable of producing a large amount of noise. Apart from that, various equipment like compressors, generators, exhaust fans, grinding mills also participates in producing big noise. </p>

<p> You’re probably familiar with the sight of workers in these factories and industries wearing earplugs to minimize the effect of noise. </p>

<p> However, even after taking precautionary measures like these, extensive exposure to high levels of noise might damage their hearing abilities in the long run. </p>

<h3> 2. Poor Urban Planning </h3>

<p> In most of the developing countries, poor urban planning also plays a vital role. Congested houses, large families sharing small space, fight over parking, frequent fights over basic amenities lead to noise pollution, which may disrupt the environment of society. </p>

<p> Noise pollution in urban settings may also be caused when residential properties and industrial buildings are in proximity. In situations like these, the noise from the nearby industrial property might hinder the basic well-being of the individuals living in residential properties. </p>

<h3> 3. Social Events </h3>

<p> Noise is at its peak in most of the social events. Whether it is marriage, parties, pub, disc or place of worship, people normally flout rules set by the local administration and create a nuisance in the area. </p>

<p> People play songs on full volume and dance till midnight, which makes the condition of people living nearby pretty worse. In markets, you can see people selling clothes via making a loud noise to attract the attention of people. </p>

<p> While this may not seem like much at the outset, over time, it affects the hearing abilities of the individuals who are constantly exposed to these sounds. </p>

<h3> 4. Transportation </h3>

<p> A large number of vehicles on roads, airplanes flying over houses, underground trains produce heavy noise, and people find it difficult to get accustomed to that. </p>

<p> The high noise leads to a situation wherein a normal person loses the ability to hear properly. </p>

<h3> 5. Construction Activities </h3>

<p> Under construction activities like mining, construction of bridges, dams, buildings, stations, roads, flyovers takes place in almost every part of the world. </p>

<p> These construction activities take place every day as we need more buildings, bridges to accommodate more people. </p>

<p> However, while this does help us to some degree, in the long run, the noise from construction activities hinders the hearing abilities of individuals exposed to this sound. </p>

<p> A part of it includes construction workers who participate in these activities, while another part of it consists of people who encounter these noise either from their homes or while traveling. </p>

<h3> 6. Household Chores </h3>

<p> We people are surrounded by gadgets and use them extensively in our daily life. Gadgets like TV, mobile, mixer grinder, pressure cooker, vacuum cleaners, washing machine and dryer, cooler, air conditioners are minor contributors to the amount of noise that is produced. Still, it affects the quality of life of your neighborhood in a bad way. </p>

<p> While this form of pollution may seem harmless, it, in fact, has far-reaching consequences. The adverse effects on the health of the environment are quite severe. Not only is the local wildlife affected by pollution, but humans also face a number of problems due to it. </p>

<h3> 7. Noise From Air Traffic </h3>

<p> While many find it difficult to believe, air traffic too contributes to significant levels of noise pollution. Noise from a single aircraft may produce sounds of up to 130 dB. Now, imagine the amount of noise produced by the numerous aircraft traveling our airspace. </p>

<h3> 8. Catering and Nightlife </h3>

<p> When the weather is good, restaurants, bars, and terraces spill outside. Late night parties continue with loud music and unnecessary noise made by the party mongers. These can produce more than 100 dB. The noise from pubs and clubs are also included. </p>

<h3> 9. Animals’ Sound </h3>

<p> The noise made by animals cannot go unnoticed, particularly a howling or barking dog. These can produce noise around 60-80 dB. </p>

<h2> Effects </h2>

<h3> 1. Hearing Problems </h3>

<p> Any unwanted sound that our ears have not been built to filter can cause problems within the body. Our ears can take in a certain range of sounds without getting damaged. </p>

<p> Man-made noises such as jackhammers, horns, machinery, airplanes, and even vehicles can be too loud for our hearing range. </p>

<p> Constant exposure to loud levels of noise can easily result in the damage of our eardrums and loss of hearing, causing tinnitus or deafness. It also reduces our sensitivity to sounds that our ears pick up unconsciously to regulate our body’s rhythm. </p>

<h3> 2. Psychological Issues </h3>

<p> Excessive noise pollution in working areas such as offices, construction sites, bars and even in our homes can influence psychological health. </p>

<p> Studies show that the occurrence of aggressive behavior, disturbance of sleep, constant stress, fatigue, depression, anxiety, hysteria and hypertension in humans as well as animals can be linked to excessive noise levels. The level of irritation increases with increased noise, and people tend to become less and less patient. These, in turn, can cause more severe and chronic health issues later in life. </p>

<h3> 3. Physical Problems </h3>

<p> Noise pollution can cause headaches, high blood pressure, respiratory agitation, racing pulse, and, in exposure to extremely loud, constant noise, gastritis, colitis and even heart attacks may occur. </p>

<h3> 4. Cognitive Issues & Behavioral Changes </h3>

<p> Noise affects brain responses and people’s ability to focus, which can lead to low-performance levels over time. Like other sound waves, too much noise when it goes to the brain leads to lower response rates as well as making the mind dull. </p>

<p> It is also poor for memory, making it hard to study. The studies have shown that school children living near railway stations or airports have problems in learning. </p>

<p> Research has shown that people who live near airports or busy roads, usually have a higher incidence of headaches, take more sleeping pills and sedatives, are more prone to minor accidents, and are more likely to seek psychiatric treatment. </p>

<h3> 5. Sleeping Disorders </h3>

<p> While it may not seem like much at this point, excessively high levels of noise are likely to hamper your sleeping pattern, thereby leading to irritation and uncomfortable situations. </p>

<p> Without a good night’s sleep, you might experience multiple problems related to fatigue. This will affect your performance in the office as well as at home. It is therefore recommended to take a sound sleep to give your body proper rest. </p>

<p> If a certain noise is disturbing your sleep, take an actionable measure to reduce it. While in some instances, it is completely unavoidable; there are other instances (like noise from TV or gadgets) that can be easily avoided by making good lifestyle changes. </p>

<p> Interestingly, our ears need rest for 16 hours and even more to make up for two hours of exposure to 100 dB. </p>
