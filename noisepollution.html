<h1> Noise Pollution </h1>

<h2> Definition </h2>

<p> Noise pollution, also known as environmental noise or sound pollution, is the propagation of noise with ranging impacts on the activity of human or animal life, most of them harmful to a degree. The source of outdoor noise worldwide is mainly caused by machines, transport, and propagation systems. Poor urban planning may give rise to noise disintegration or pollution, side-by-side industrial and residential buildings can result in noise pollution in the residential areas. Some of the main sources of noise in residential areas include loud music, transportation (traffic, rail, airplanes, etc.), lawn care maintenance, construction, electrical generators, explosions, and people. </p>

<p> Documented problems associated with noise in urban environments go back as far as ancient Rome. Today, the average noise level of 98 decibels (dB) exceeds the WHO value of 50 dB allowed for residential areas. Research suggests that noise pollution is the highest in low-income and racial minority neighborhoods, and noise pollution associated with household electricity generators is an emerging environmental degradation in many developing nations. </p>

<p> High noise levels can contribute to cardiovascular effects in humans and an increased incidence of coronary artery disease. In animals, noise can increase the risk of death by altering predator or prey detection and avoidance, interfere with reproduction and navigation, and contribute to permanent hearing loss. A substantial amount of the noise that humans produce occurs in the ocean. Up until recently, most research on noise impacts has been focused on marine mammals, and to a lesser degree, fish. In the past few years, scientists have shifted to conducting studies on invertebrates and their responses to anthropogenic sounds in the marine environment. This research is essential, especially considering that invertebrates make up 75% of marine species, and thus compose a large percentage of ocean food webs. Of the studies that have been conducted, a sizable variety in families of invertebrates have been represented in the research. A variation in the complexity of their sensory systems exists, which allows scientists to study a range of characteristics and develop a better understanding of anthropogenic noise impacts on living organisms. </p>

<h2> Causes </h2>

<h3> 1. Industrialization </h3>

<p> Most of the industries use big machines which are capable of producing a large amount of noise. Apart from that, various equipment like compressors, generators, exhaust fans, grinding mills also participates in producing big noise. </p>

<p> You’re probably familiar with the sight of workers in these factories and industries wearing earplugs to minimize the effect of noise. </p>

<p> However, even after taking precautionary measures like these, extensive exposure to high levels of noise might damage their hearing abilities in the long run. </p>

<h3> 2. Poor Urban Planning </h3>

<p> In most of the developing countries, poor urban planning also plays a vital role. Congested houses, large families sharing small space, fight over parking, frequent fights over basic amenities lead to noise pollution, which may disrupt the environment of society. </p>

<p> Noise pollution in urban settings may also be caused when residential properties and industrial buildings are in proximity. In situations like these, the noise from the nearby industrial property might hinder the basic well-being of the individuals living in residential properties. </p>

<h3> 3. Social Events </h3>

<p> Noise is at its peak in most of the social events. Whether it is marriage, parties, pub, disc or place of worship, people normally flout rules set by the local administration and create a nuisance in the area. </p>

<p> People play songs on full volume and dance till midnight, which makes the condition of people living nearby pretty worse. In markets, you can see people selling clothes via making a loud noise to attract the attention of people. </p>

<p> While this may not seem like much at the outset, over time, it affects the hearing abilities of the individuals who are constantly exposed to these sounds. </p>

<h3> 4. Transportation </h3>

<p> A large number of vehicles on roads, airplanes flying over houses, underground trains produce heavy noise, and people find it difficult to get accustomed to that. </p>

<p> The high noise leads to a situation wherein a normal person loses the ability to hear properly. </p>

<h3> 5. Construction Activities </h3>

<p> Under construction activities like mining, construction of bridges, dams, buildings, stations, roads, flyovers takes place in almost every part of the world. </p>

<p> These construction activities take place every day as we need more buildings, bridges to accommodate more people. </p>

<p> However, while this does help us to some degree, in the long run, the noise from construction activities hinders the hearing abilities of individuals exposed to this sound. </p>

<p> A part of it includes construction workers who participate in these activities, while another part of it consists of people who encounter these noise either from their homes or while traveling. </p>

<h3> 6. Household Chores </h3>

<p> We people are surrounded by gadgets and use them extensively in our daily life. Gadgets like TV, mobile, mixer grinder, pressure cooker, vacuum cleaners, washing machine and dryer, cooler, air conditioners are minor contributors to the amount of noise that is produced. Still, it affects the quality of life of your neighborhood in a bad way. </p>

<p> While this form of pollution may seem harmless, it, in fact, has far-reaching consequences. The adverse effects on the health of the environment are quite severe. Not only is the local wildlife affected by pollution, but humans also face a number of problems due to it. </p>

<h3> 7. Noise From Air Traffic </h3>

<p> While many find it difficult to believe, air traffic too contributes to significant levels of noise pollution. Noise from a single aircraft may produce sounds of up to 130 dB. Now, imagine the amount of noise produced by the numerous aircraft traveling our airspace. </p>

<h3> 8. Catering and Nightlife </h3>

<p> When the weather is good, restaurants, bars, and terraces spill outside. Late night parties continue with loud music and unnecessary noise made by the party mongers. These can produce more than 100 dB. The noise from pubs and clubs are also included. </p>

<h3> 9. Animals’ Sound </h3>

<p> The noise made by animals cannot go unnoticed, particularly a howling or barking dog. These can produce noise around 60-80 dB. </p>

<h2> Effects </h2>

<h3> 1. Hearing Problems </h3>

<p> Any unwanted sound that our ears have not been built to filter can cause problems within the body. Our ears can take in a certain range of sounds without getting damaged. </p>

<p> Man-made noises such as jackhammers, horns, machinery, airplanes, and even vehicles can be too loud for our hearing range. </p>

<p> Constant exposure to loud levels of noise can easily result in the damage of our eardrums and loss of hearing, causing tinnitus or deafness. It also reduces our sensitivity to sounds that our ears pick up unconsciously to regulate our body’s rhythm. </p>

<h3> 2. Psychological Issues </h3>

<p> Excessive noise pollution in working areas such as offices, construction sites, bars and even in our homes can influence psychological health. </p>

<p> Studies show that the occurrence of aggressive behavior, disturbance of sleep, constant stress, fatigue, depression, anxiety, hysteria and hypertension in humans as well as animals can be linked to excessive noise levels. The level of irritation increases with increased noise, and people tend to become less and less patient. These, in turn, can cause more severe and chronic health issues later in life. </p>

<h3> 3. Physical Problems </h3>

<p> Noise pollution can cause headaches, high blood pressure, respiratory agitation, racing pulse, and, in exposure to extremely loud, constant noise, gastritis, colitis and even heart attacks may occur. </p>

<h3> 4. Cognitive Issues & Behavioral Changes </h3>

<p> Noise affects brain responses and people’s ability to focus, which can lead to low-performance levels over time. Like other sound waves, too much noise when it goes to the brain leads to lower response rates as well as making the mind dull. </p>

<p> It is also poor for memory, making it hard to study. The studies have shown that school children living near railway stations or airports have problems in learning. </p>

<p> Research has shown that people who live near airports or busy roads, usually have a higher incidence of headaches, take more sleeping pills and sedatives, are more prone to minor accidents, and are more likely to seek psychiatric treatment. </p>

<h3> 5. Sleeping Disorders </h3>

<p> While it may not seem like much at this point, excessively high levels of noise are likely to hamper your sleeping pattern, thereby leading to irritation and uncomfortable situations. </p>

<p> Without a good night’s sleep, you might experience multiple problems related to fatigue. This will affect your performance in the office as well as at home. It is therefore recommended to take a sound sleep to give your body proper rest. </p>

<p> If a certain noise is disturbing your sleep, take an actionable measure to reduce it. While in some instances, it is completely unavoidable; there are other instances (like noise from TV or gadgets) that can be easily avoided by making good lifestyle changes. </p>

<p> Interestingly, our ears need rest for 16 hours and even more to make up for two hours of exposure to 100 dB. </p>

<h3> 6. Cardiovascular Issues </h3>

<p> Blood pressure levels, cardiovascular disease, and stress-related heart problems are on the rise. </p>

<p> Studies suggest that high-intensity noise causes high blood pressure and increases heartbeat rate as it disrupts the normal blood flow. </p>

<p> Since bringing these rates to a manageable level depends on our understanding of noise pollution, we need to be wary of the ill-effects and tackle these situations mindfully. </p>

<h3> 7. Trouble Communicating </h3>

<p> High decibel noise can put trouble and affect free communication between people. This may lead to misunderstanding, and you may get difficult understanding the other person. Constant sharp noise can give you a severe headache and disturb your emotional balance </p>

<h3> 8. Effect on Wildlife </h3>

<p> Wildlife faces far more problems than humans because of noise pollution since they are more dependent on sound. Animals develop a better sense of hearing than us since their survival depends on it. </p>

<p> A recent study published in Biology Letters found that human-created noise affects a wide range of animals. The ill-effects of excessive noise begin at home. Pets react more aggressively in households where there is constant noise. </p>

<p> They become disoriented more easily and face many behavioral problems. In nature, animals may suffer from hearing loss, which makes them easy prey and leads to dwindling populations. Others become inefficient at hunting, disturbing the balance of the eco-system. </p>

<h3> 9. Effects on Species Depending on Mating Call </h3>

<p> Species that depend on mating calls to reproduce are often unable to hear these calls due to excessive man-made noise. </p>

<p> As a result, they are unable to reproduce and cause declining populations. Others require sound waves to locate and find their way when migrating. </p>

<p> Disturbing their sound signals means they get lost easily and do not migrate when they should. To cope up with the increasing sound around them, animals are becoming louder, which may further add to the pollution levels. This is why understanding noise pollution can help us lower the impact it has on the environment. </p>

<h2> Solutions </h2>

<h3> 1. Close the Windows </h3>

<p> Reducing the amount of noise entering into our homes and buildings is possible by simply closing the windows. It keeps away annoying sound. The best thing would be to only open windows during the quieter times of the day, most probably late in the evenings. </p>

<h3> 2. Put on Earplugs </h3>

<p> Wearing earplugs is a cost-effective solution for reducing noise pollution. A pair of earplugs can be worn while sleeping or at any other time of the day when you want to reduce the amount of noise hitting your eardrums. </p>

<p> Earplugs have their health benefits, especially for those who wish to have a healthy sleeping habit in noisy areas. </p>

<h3> 3. Improve your Insulation </h3>

<p> Insulation measures are some of the primary and most practical ways to reduce noise pollution at home. It’s an art of soundproofing, which helps in blocking the sound vibrations and noise. </p>

<p> By improving insulation, it means installing soundproofing materials on the walls, ceiling, and even on the floor. Using double-pane windows and weather-stripping in your home can aid in absorbing noise and work as added insulation saving energy bill. </p>

<h3> 4. Invest in Noise-Canceling Headphones </h3>

<p> The majority of people may not realize this, but sound-canceling headphones are good for reducing noise pollution. It’s essentially important for industrial and construction workers. The noise-canceling headphones filter the unwanted noise well before it reaches the ears. </p>

<h3> 5. Do Wall-to-Wall Carpeting </h3>

<p> Wall-to-wall carpeting comes in as another practical and straightforward way of reducing noise pollution. This kind of arrangement goes a long way in lowering incoming noise into our homes or offices. </p>

<h3> 6. Install a Fence </h3>

<p> It may sound extreme, but it qualifies as a practical way to reduce noise pollution. Noise is produced by strong sound waves or vibrations, which can be significantly reduced by barriers. </p>

<p> By installing a fence, you’ll be creating a barrier that absorbs the strong sound waves or vibrations, thereby reducing noise pollution around your office or home. </p>

<h3> 7. Be Creative with the Office or House Layout </h3>

<p> One way to reduce noise in the house or an office setting is to get innovative with the general layout or design. For instance, noisy machines can be placed in areas that are not close to the sitting/resting or working areas. </p>

<h3> 8. Invest in Noise-Friendly Flooring </h3>

<p> Floors can offer remarkable ways of reducing noise pollution. However, it depends on the type of floor you have in your place. Carpeting, for instance, usually reduces a substantial amount of noise, but better results can be achieved by the use of noise-friendly flooring like vinyl. </p>

<h3> 9. Invest in Sound-Friendly Furniture </h3>

<p> Furniture is excellent sound absorbers as they reduce echo and sound vibrations. Therefore, sound friendly lounge chairs, bookshelves, couches, and cabinets can affect the acoustics of open spaces. </p>

<p> For instance, in the case of a noisy neighbor, put a big bookshelf against the wall to reduce the noise coming from their house or building. Also, use soft furnishings such as rugs, carpets, and wall hangings, which reduce sound. </p>

<h3> 10. Use of Modern Acoustic Wall Panels </h3>

<p> Not all wall panels incredibly serve well at reducing noise pollution. Because of technological advancements, there are modern designed acoustic wall panel options available in the market that can effectively reduce noise pollution. </p>

<h3> 11. Turn off Electronic Devices or Reduce the Volume </h3>

<p> Game systems, computers, Hi-fi systems, and televisions can contribute to noise pollution when on high volumes. The solution is to turn them off when not in use and also keep them on moderate volume to reduce noise pollution. </p>

<p> Besides, by turning them off, you’ll also be saving electricity costs. Place padding under noisy equipment to reduce noise, such as blenders. </p>

<h3> 12. Use Noise Absorbants in Noisy Mystery </h3>

<p> If some pieces of machinery are creating noise due to vibrations, you can check the noise by applying some noise absorbents to reduce noise. </p>

<h3> 13. Do Frequent Lubrication and Better Maintenance of Machinery </h3>

<p> Proper lubrication and better maintenance of machines are beneficial practices to reduce noise pollution and improve efficiency. As lubrication reduces friction between movable parts, it helps to reduce noise. </p>

<h3> 14. Plant Trees </h3>

<p> Trees have been established to be effective in reducing noise levels within urban settings, around major highways, and even at the places, we stay. </p>

<p> Therefore, numerous plants and trees in an area mean less noise pollution. In addition to that, trees have various aesthetic advantages and improve air quality. </p>

<h3> 15. Have a Dedicated Quiet Space </h3>

<p> Having a dedicated quiet space can pay off whenever we want to escape from noises that make us feel uneasy and affect the quality of our life. Quiet spaces can guarantee as much as 100% soundproof areas. </p>

<h3> 16. Install Cubicles and Wall Partitions <h3>

<p> Installation of wall partitions and cubicles in places such as offices with ample free space and big rooms at home reduces the overall indoor noise. Even with low-level installation, cubicles and wall partitions proved to be very useful noise absorbers. </p>

<h3> 17. Shut the Door </h3>

<p> Shutting the door keeps away unpleasant sounds, especially if you have noisy neighbors. If there are appliances that produce loud noise such as dishwashers, blenders, and washing machines, you can have them run in separate rooms and shut the door to seal off the noise. </p>

<h3> 18. Cancel or Mask the Noise </h3>

<p> Canceling or masking the noise is one of the most straightforward and practical techniques for reducing noise pollution. It is achieved through the creation of peaceful and soothing sounds to cancel the awful ones. </p>

<p> It can simply be done by turning on a fan or hanging wind chimes. For the majority of people, it may seem contradictory, but it is a proven effective method of masking or canceling the horrible and bothering sounds. </p>

<p> Furthermore, there are white noise machines that can make canceling or masking easier. </p>

<h3> 19. Move or Choose a Home in Noise-Free Areas </h3>

<p> Moving away from noisy areas can also qualify as a practical way of reducing noise pollution. It may sound exaggerated, but moving from areas such as airports, train stations, industrial districts, and major highways can reduce noise levels considerably. </p>

<h3> 20. Replace Old Automobiles with New Ones </h3>

<p> Old automobiles are a significant source of noise pollution. They create unappealing and sometimes deafening sounds. Their replacement with new ones not only reduces noise pollution but will also lower the emission of soot and other toxic substances into the atmosphere. </p>

<h3> 21. Create Awareness and Education on the Consequences of Noise Pollution </h3>

<p> Creating awareness of noise pollution and its effects on both humans and wildlife can generate positive outcomes in efforts to reduce noise pollution. </p>

<p> Perhaps if most people could be aware that noise pollution can lead to hearing loss and mental stress, then the majority will invest in ways to reduce noise pollution. </p>

<h3> 22. Declare a “No Horn Zone” in Hospital, School, and Residential Areas </h3>

<p> Horns from trucks, buses, and cars produce a considerable degree of noise pollution and as such, the introduction of no horn zone can help reduce noise pollution in hospitals, schools, and residential areas. </p>

<h3> 23. Let’s all be Good Neighbors </h3>

<p> Being a good neighbor means maintaining awareness of loud music, barking dogs, or loud parties, among others. Keeping these on a check can make your neighbor follow the same, which eventually contributes to an easy and practical way of reducing noise pollution. </p>

<h3> 24. Put Pressure on the Relevant City or Governing Authorities to Introduce Noise Regulation Policies </h3>

<p> Governing and city authorities hold the power to introduce policies that can help reduce noise pollution. The laws should limit the amount of noise in public and private places to cut noise pollution. </p>

<p> The policies can also be integrated into transportation network construction and activities such as low-noise road surfaces, low-noise tracks, redesigning street spaces, enforcing speed limits, and reducing traffic volume. </p>

<h3> 25. Do Regular Checking of Noise Levels </h3>

<p> Keeping the noise level within the limit requires frequent verification of noise level in an industrial complex and indoor. Therefore see to it that regular checking of noise level is done. </p>

<h3> 26. Notify Authority for Breaking Noise Rules </h3>

<p> You can notify government agencies if someone in a neighbor is not following rules and regulations regarding noise levels and also not maintaining the noise limit set by the city authority. </p>

<h3> 27. The Use of Calming Green Waves </h3>

<p> These are the highway and noisy areas (such as airports, train stations, and industries) sound insulation measures that can help absorb the huge sounds produced by the operating machines. </p>
