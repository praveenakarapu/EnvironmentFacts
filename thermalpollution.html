<h1> Thermal Pollution </h1>

<h2> Definition </h2>

<p> Thermal pollution, sometimes called "thermal enrichment," is the degradation of water quality by any process that changes ambient water temperature. A common cause of thermal pollution is the use of water as a coolant by power plants and industrial manufacturers. When water used as a coolant is returned to the natural environment at a higher temperature, the sudden change in temperature decreases oxygen supply and affects ecosystem composition. Fish and other organisms adapted to particular temperature range can be killed by an abrupt change in water temperature (either a rapid increase or decrease) known as "thermal shock." </p>

<p> Urban runoff—stormwater discharged to surface waters from roads and parking lots—can also be a source of elevated water temperatures. </p>

<h2> Causes </h2>

<h3> 1. Water as a Cooling Agent in Power, Manufacturing and Industrial Plants </h3>

<p> Production and Manufacturing plants are the biggest sources of thermal pollution. These plants draw water from a nearby source to keep machines cool and then release back to the source with higher temperatures. When heated water returns to the river or ocean, the water temperature rises sharply. </p>

<p> When oxygen levels are altered in the water, this can also degrade the quality and longevity of life in wildlife that lives underwater. This process can also wipe away streamside vegetation, which constantly depends on constant levels of oxygen and temperature. </p>

<p> By altering these natural environments, industries are essentially helping decrease the quality of life for these marine-based life forms, which can ultimately destroy habitats if they are not controlled and careful about their practices. </p>

<h3> 2. Soil Erosion </h3>

<p> Soil erosion is another major factor that causes thermal pollution. Consistent soil erosion causes water bodies to rise, making them more exposed to sunlight. The high temperature could prove fatal for aquatic biomes as it may give rise to anaerobic conditions. </p>

<h3> 3. Deforestation </h3>

<p> Trees and plants prevent sunlight from falling directly on lakes, ponds or rivers. When deforestation takes place, these water bodies are directly exposed to sunlight, thus absorbing more heat and raising its temperature. Deforestation is also the main cause of the higher concentrations of greenhouse gases, i.e. global warming in the atmosphere. </p>

<h3> 4. Runoff From Paved Surfaces </h3>

<p> Urban runoff discharged to surface waters from paved surfaces like roads and parking lots can make the water warmer. During summer seasons, the pavement gets quite hot, which creates warm runoffs that get into the sewer systems and water bodies. </p>

<h3> 5. Natural Causes </h3>

<p> Natural causes like volcanoes, geothermal vents and hot springs under the oceans and seas can trigger warm lava to raise the temperature of water bodies. Lightening can also introduce a massive amount of heat into the oceans. This means that the overall temperature of the water source will rise, having significant impacts on the environment. </p>

<h3> 6. Retention Ponds </h3>

<p> Retention ponds can be another source of thermal shock because the water bodies that are relatively small and shallow can absorb quite a bit of heat energy from the sun. </p>

<p> When that water is pumped directly into a river, lake, or bay, it causes a significant temperature increase. It is similar to pouring a pitcher of water into a bathtub full of water that causes the water to jump a few degrees Fahrenheit. </p>

<h3> 7. Domestic Sewage </h3>

<p> Domestic sewage is often discharged into rivers, lakes, canals or streams without treating the waste. The temperature of municipal water sewage is normally high than receiving water. </p>

<p> With the increase in temperature of the receiving water, the dissolved oxygen (DO) decreases, and the demand for oxygen increases, causing anaerobic conditions. </p>

<h2> Effects </h2>

<h3> 1. Decrease in Dissolved Oxygen Levels </h3>

<p> The warm temperature reduces the levels of DO (Dissolved Oxygen) in water. The warm water holds relatively less oxygen than cold water. The decrease in DO can create suffocation for plants and animals such as fish, amphibians and copepods, which may give rise to anaerobic conditions. </p>

<p> Warmer water allows algae to flourish on the surface of the water, and over the long term, growing algae can decrease oxygen levels in the water. </p>

<h3> 2. Increase in Toxins </h3>

<p> With the constant flow of high-temperature discharge from industries, there is a huge increase in toxins that are being regurgitated into the natural body of water. These toxins may contain chemicals or radiation that may have a harsh impact on the local ecology and make them susceptible to various diseases. </p>

<h3> 3. Loss of Biodiversity </h3>

<p> A dent in the biological activity in the water may cause a significant loss of biodiversity. Changes in the environment may cause certain species of organisms to shift their base to some other place while there could be a significant number of species that may shift in because of warmer waters. </p>

<p> Organisms that can adapt easily may have an advantage over organisms that are not used to the warmer temperatures. </p>

<h3> 4. Ecological Impact </h3>

<p> A sudden thermal shock can result in mass killings of fish, insects, plants or amphibians. Hotter water may prove favorable for some species, while it could be lethal for other species. Small water temperature increases the level of activity, while higher temperature decreases the level of activity. </p>

<p> Many aquatic species are sensitive to small temperature changes such as one degree Celsius that can cause significant changes in organism metabolism and other adverse cellular biology effects. </p>

<h3> 5. Affects Reproductive Systems </h3>

<p> A significant halt in the reproduction of marine wildlife (although this may be true, reproduction can still occur between fish – but the likelihood of defects in newborns is significantly higher) can happen due to increasing temperatures as reproduction can happen within a certain range of temperature. Excessive temperature can cause the release of immature eggs or can prevent the normal development of certain eggs. </p>

<h3> 6. Increases Metabolic Rate </h3>

<p> Thermal pollution increases the metabolic rate of organisms as increasing enzyme activity occurs that causes organisms to consume more food than what is normally required if their environment were not changed. It disrupts the stability of the food chain and alters the balance of species composition. </p>

<h3> 7. Migration </h3>

<p> The warm water can also cause particular species of organisms to migrate to a suitable environment that would cater to its requirements for survival. This can result in a loss for those species that depend on them for their daily food as their food chain is interrupted. </p>

<h2> Solutions </h2>

<h3> 1. Cooling Ponds </h3>

<p> Cooling ponds or reservoirs are the simplest methods of controlling thermal discharges. In cooling ponds, heated effluents on the surface of water maximize the dissipation of heat to the atmosphere and minimize the area and volume of water. </p>

<p> This is the simplest and cheapest method that cools the water to a considerably low temperature. However, the method alone is less desirable as well as inefficient in terms of air-water contact. </p>

<h3> 2. Cooling Towers </h3>

<p> After using water from water sources for cooling purposes, it is subsequently returned to the water body after passing through the condenser, which is termed as the cooling process. </p>

<p> Therefore cooling towers are designed to control the temperature of water to make the cooling process more effective. Cooling towers are mainly used to dissipate the recovered waste heat to eliminate the problems of thermal pollution. </p>

<h3> 3. Artificial Lake </h3>

<p> Artificial lakes are man-made water bodies that offer a possible alternative. The heated effluents may be discharged into the lake at one end, and the water may be withdrawn from the other end for cooling purposes. The heat is eventually dissipated through evaporation. However, these lakes have to be rejuvenated continuously. </p>

<h3> 4. Water Recycling </h3>

<p> Industrially treated water can be recycled for domestic use or industrial heating that the problem of thermal pollution can be mitigated. </p>
