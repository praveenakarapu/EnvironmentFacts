<h1> Thermal Pollution </h1>

<h2> Definition </h2>

<p> Thermal pollution, sometimes called "thermal enrichment," is the degradation of water quality by any process that changes ambient water temperature. A common cause of thermal pollution is the use of water as a coolant by power plants and industrial manufacturers. When water used as a coolant is returned to the natural environment at a higher temperature, the sudden change in temperature decreases oxygen supply and affects ecosystem composition. Fish and other organisms adapted to particular temperature range can be killed by an abrupt change in water temperature (either a rapid increase or decrease) known as "thermal shock." </p>

<p> Urban runoff—stormwater discharged to surface waters from roads and parking lots—can also be a source of elevated water temperatures. </p>

<h2> Causes </h2>

<h3> 1. Water as a Cooling Agent in Power, Manufacturing and Industrial Plants </h3>

<p> Production and Manufacturing plants are the biggest sources of thermal pollution. These plants draw water from a nearby source to keep machines cool and then release back to the source with higher temperatures. When heated water returns to the river or ocean, the water temperature rises sharply. </p>

<p> When oxygen levels are altered in the water, this can also degrade the quality and longevity of life in wildlife that lives underwater. This process can also wipe away streamside vegetation, which constantly depends on constant levels of oxygen and temperature. </p>

<p> By altering these natural environments, industries are essentially helping decrease the quality of life for these marine-based life forms, which can ultimately destroy habitats if they are not controlled and careful about their practices. </p>
