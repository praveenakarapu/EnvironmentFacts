<h1> Here are 4 solutions to thermal pollution. </h1>

<h2> 1. Cooling Ponds </h2>

<p> Cooling ponds or reservoirs are the simplest methods of controlling thermal discharges. In cooling ponds, heated effluents on the surface of water maximize the dissipation of heat to the atmosphere and minimize the area and volume of water. </p>

<p> This is the simplest and cheapest method that cools the water to a considerably low temperature. However, the method alone is less desirable as well as inefficient in terms of air-water contact. </p>

<h2> 2. Cooling Towers </h2>

<p> After using water from water sources for cooling purposes, it is subsequently returned to the water body after passing through the condenser, which is termed as the cooling process. </p>

<p> Therefore cooling towers are designed to control the temperature of water to make the cooling process more effective. Cooling towers are mainly used to dissipate the recovered waste heat to eliminate the problems of thermal pollution. </p>

<h2> 3. Artificial Lake </h2>

<p> Artificial lakes are man-made water bodies that offer a possible alternative. The heated effluents may be discharged into the lake at one end, and the water may be withdrawn from the other end for cooling purposes. The heat is eventually dissipated through evaporation. However, these lakes have to be rejuvenated continuously. </p>

<h2> 4. Water Recycling </h2>

<p> Industrially treated water can be recycled for domestic use or industrial heating that the problem of thermal pollution can be mitigated. </p>
