<h1> Here are 7 solutions to radioactive pollution solutions. </h1>

<h2> 1. Proper Method of Disposing of Radioactive Waste </h2>

<p> Radioactive waste still has some level of radiation. Accordingly, it cannot be disposed of in the same way as normal waste. It cannot be incinerated or buried. Since there is a likelihood of seepage, this waste should be stored in heavy and thick concrete containers. </p>

<p> Another option is to dilute the radiation since storage may not be possible. Since there are no easy ways of disposing of radioactive material, professional assistance should always be sought. </p>

<h2> 2. Proper Labeling </h2>

<p> It is necessary for any material with radioactive content to be labeled, and the necessary precautions advised on the content of the label. The reason for this is because radiation can enter the body by a mere touch of radioactive material. Containers with such elements should be well labeled in order to make one use protective gear when handling them. </p>

<h2> 3. Banning of Nuclear Tests </h2>

<p> It has already been proven that nuclear power has a lot of inactive power that is very destructive. Nevertheless, the tests done to perfect the energy contribute greatly to the overall presence of radioactive substances. Moreover, these tests, though done in the deserts, end up escaping from one ecosystem to another, eventually affecting the lives of many people. </p>

<h2> 4. Alternative Energy Sources </h2>

<p> The evolution and use of nuclear power was not a bad thing initially. However, considering the damage and threats it has on the environment, it is high time for its use to be discontinued and for the world to perhaps focus on alternative and environmentally friendly energy sources â€“ like renewable sources of energy namely solar, hydro-electric and wind power. </p>

<p> The use of radioactivity to generate energy in nuclear power plants, for example, leads to the production of more radiation to the atmosphere considering the waste released from the various processes and combustion. </p>

<h2> 5. Proper Storage </h2>

<p> It is impportant for containers carrying radioactive material to be stored properly. For starters, such substances should be stored in radiation proof containers to ensure no seeping or leakage during handling. Proper storage means no harm and can minimize cases of accidental leakage. </p>

<h2> 6. Reusing </h2>

<p> Since it is not easy to store or dispose the waste, it can be recycled and used for other purposes like in another reactor as fuel thereby protecting the environment. </p>

<h2> 7. Precautions at the Personal Level </h2>

<p> There may be the possibility of contamination if one owns a house located near a nuclear power plant. In that case, it is recommended to check the level of radon gas in your building. The radon level needs to be removed. Those who work with radioactive material are also at great risk. They need protective measures to keep away from radioactive contamination. </p>
