<h1> Air Pollution </h1>


<p> Air pollution is the presence of substances in the atmosphere that are harmful to the health of humans and other living beings, or cause damage to the climate or to materials.
There are different types of air pollutants, such as gases (such as ammonia, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxides, methane and chlorofluorocarbons), particulates (both organic and inorganic), and biological molecules.
Air pollution may cause diseases, allergies and death to humans. It may also cause harm to other living organisms such as animals and crops, and may damage the natural or built environment. </p>

<p> Air pollution is a significant risk factor for a number of pollution-related diseases, including respiratory infections, heart disease, COPD (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), stroke, and lung cancer. The human health effects of poor air quality are far reaching, but principally affect the body's respiratory system and the cardiovascular system. 
Individual reactions to air pollutants depend on the type of pollutant a person is exposed to, the degree of exposure, and the individual's health status and genetics.
Indoor air pollution and poor urban air quality are listed as two of the world's worst toxic pollution problems in the 2008 Blacksmith Institute World's Worst Polluted Places report.
Outdoor air pollution alone causes 2,100,000 to 4,210,000 deaths annually. Overall, air pollution causes the deaths of around 7 million people worldwide each year, and is the world's largest single environmental health risk. </p>

<p> Productivity losses and degraded quality of life caused by air pollution are estimated to cost the world economy 5 trillion dollars per year. Various pollution control technologies and strategies are available to reduce air pollution. </p>
